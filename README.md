This is my submission for the Dockercon 2015 Hackathon: When it comes to critical security updates, Informing the users of your software can be challenging - Docker can provide a solution

# docksec

Cyber crime is on the rise, whether it is Heartbleed or your wordpress 0day sql injection, the users of such software need to be notified as soon as possible. 

But users can acquire the software through a multitude of channels so keeping them all up-to-date can be challenging. But in the world of containerized applications, Docker can provide a solution.

I would like to create a Docker plugin that automatically notifies users of potential security issues in the images they use.
