When we're talking about security, the internet is the true wild wild west of today and the problems doesn't seem to be disappearing anytime soon. Until we find a way to create bulletproof server software we'll need a system in place to react as quick as possible to the release of a new 0-day vulnerability. 

Traditionally it can be very difficult for a software vendor to inform their consumers. Especially for open source projects, the product is often acquired (anonymously) through a variety of channels and contacting the user can be downright impossible. Docker can provide a solution, as an universal runtime it can also act as a real time channel for receiving and acting on new vulnerabilities.
